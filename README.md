For Running Python Code,
I used open source Prophet library from Facebook (fbprophet). We need to install pystan and fbprophet to run my python code. Please find my .py file and .ipynp files in GitHub. (We can install these by using pip install fbprophet, pip install pystan)
https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/quick_start.html#python-api will help in installing fbprophet and pystan

Inventory Planning System can be found in GitHub with file name Weighted Model.xlsx.
Page "Analysis" gives how to optimize the "On hand after ordered quantity and inventory" using solver and page "Ordering" is a tentative ordering system considering 1 month lead time.
